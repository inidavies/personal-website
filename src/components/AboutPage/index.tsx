        <p>
          In May of 2024, I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science from University of North
          Texas and currently work as a Software Engineer. I am a full stack developer with a passion for
          front-end development and creating applications with intuitive, useable, and user-centric designs with the aid of UX principles.
          
          Software development allows me to combine creativity with my interest in technology. My dream is to work where I can create.
